# Hi, I'm Bruno 👋

I'm a Computer Engineering student at ISEP with a strong focus on backend development, distributed systems, and full-stack engineering.  
I enjoy building real systems that work in practice — from low-level C programs with IPC to full-stack applications in Java/React with CI/CD and automated tests.

I have hands-on experience across several multi-semester engineering projects (LAPR2–LAPR5), where I worked on real architectures, applied SCRUM, and delivered production-like solutions with solid engineering practices (DDD, TDD, Clean Architecture).
